# Sudoku Solver (Backtracking Algorithm)

This project implements a basic Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm in Python. 
It takes a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku board and fills in the missing numbers according to the rules of Sudoku.

- Solves valid Sudoku puzzles using recursion and backtracking.
- Prints the board before and after solving.
- Checks for valid moves based on: Row constraints, Column constraints and 3x3 grid constraints
